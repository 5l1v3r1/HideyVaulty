# HideyVaulty
HideyVaulty is an open-source file-hiding system for Windows. It is designed for penetration testers and hackers with reverse-shell access to a Windows system, and includes the ability to lock programs away from prying eyes (to be implemented). It can currently save plain-text credentials, stored in the easily accessible "resources" folder (to be fixed).

## Prerequisites
**You will need:**

- A working Windows system
- Visual Studio 2015 or later (if you want to compile the code manually)
- The HideyVaulty EXE file (32-bit and 64-bit versions available below)
  - **Beta 0.7**
     - [HideyVaulty 0.7 x86](https://github.com/HackoTron/HideyVaulty/releases/download/v0.7-beta/HideyVaulty-0.7-x86.exe)
     - [HideyVaulty 0.7 x86_64](https://github.com/HackoTron/HideyVaulty/releases/download/v0.7-beta/HideyVaulty-0.7-x86_64.exe)

## Getting started
When HideyVaulty runs for the first time, a basic setup program will run. The program will ask/force you to create an account, 
and create the neccessary files and folders. For more information on HideyVaulty commands and their syntax, type `help` into the
HideyVaulty Shell.
