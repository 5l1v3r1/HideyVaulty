# HideyVaulty - Open-Source File-Hider
HideyVaulty is an open-source file hiding program, designed for penetration testers. It is currently only available for use on Windows targets, but eventually this will expand to MacOS and Linux. It allows penetration testers to upload files to a target system, and keep them in a secure location managed directly from the HideyVaulty Shell, which uses a secure password protection system.

## Prerequisites
**You will need:**

- A working Windows target (preferably with system-level privileges)
- Visual Studio 2015 or later (if you want to compile the code manually)

## Getting started
For a list of commands type ```help```. (Note: For a full list of commands, use ```help``` when logged in).
