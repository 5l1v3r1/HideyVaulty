# HideyVaulty
HideyVaulty is an open-source login system for Windows. It is currently in early alpha, but eventually, you will be able to use it
to lock programs away from prying eyes. It can currently save credentials, but they are not encrypted, and in the location where the .exe
file is located. Eventually, I will create a CMD based installer, to get everything in the right place.

## Prerequisites
You will need:

- A working Windows system
- Visual Studio 2015 or later (if you want to compile the code manually)
